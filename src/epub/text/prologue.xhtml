								<span>Excuse me, sirs, I pray⁠—I can’t yet speak⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Excuse me, sirs, I pray⁠—I can’t yet speak⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I’m crying now⁠—and have been all the week!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>“ ’Tis not alone this mourning suit,” good masters;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>“I’ve that within”⁠—for which there are no plasters!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Pray, would you know the reason why I’m crying?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The Comic Muse, long sick, is now a-dying!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And if she goes, my tears will never stop;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For as a player, I can’t squeeze out one drop;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I am undone, that’s all⁠—shall lose my bread⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I’d rather, but that’s nothing⁠—lose my head.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When the sweet maid is laid upon the bier,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shuter and I shall be chief mourners here.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To her a mawkish drab of spurious breed,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who deals in sentimentals, will succeed.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Poor Ned and I are dead to all intents;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We can as soon speak Greek as sentiments!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Both nervous grown, to keep our spirits up,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We now and then take down a hearty cup.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What shall we do? If Comedy forsake us,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They’ll turn us out, and no one else will take us.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But why can’t I be moral?⁠—Let me try:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My heart thus pressing⁠—fixed my face and eye⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With a sententious look, that nothing means,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>(Faces are blocks in sentimental scenes),</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thus I begin⁠—“All is not gold that glitters,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Pleasure seems sweet, but proves a glass of bitters.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When Ignorance enters, Folly is at hand;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Learning is better far than house and land.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let not your virtue trip; who trips may stumble,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And virtue is not virtue, if she tumble.”</span>

							<p>
								<span>I give it up⁠—morals won’t do for me;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To make you laugh, I must play tragedy.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One hope remains⁠—hearing the maid was ill,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A Doctor comes this night to show his skill.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To cheer her heart, and give your muscles motion,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He, in Five Draughts prepared, presents a potion:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A kind of magic charm⁠—for be assured,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If you will swallow it, the maid is cured:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But desperate the Doctor, and her case is,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If you reject the dose, and make wry faces.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>This truth he boasts, will boast it while he lives,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No poisonous drugs are mixed in what he gives.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Should he succeed, you’ll give him his degree;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If not, within he will receive no fee!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The college you, must his pretensions back,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Pronounce him Regular, or dub him Quack.</span>
